I remember wanting a "High quality" psudo random algorithm for some reason.

I'm not sure why I decided to convert the c source from https://www.pcg-random.org/ to javascript.

It did match the c tests though and I remember it being alot of fun to do.

It'll be slow as heck from memory. It emulated binary adders/etc.. to match c's behaviour or so I thought was necessary at the time.
